Power Monitoring with the mPower Smart Plug
============

(These instructions assume the mPower Mini plug. For the larger plugs, this will only monitor the first plug receptacle on the device)

1. Plug in the mPower Mini
2. Connect to the plug over WiFi
3. Generally the next step is to set up the device to associate with a particular network. However, this step isn't necessary for our purposes and data can be collected directly from the device without setting it up.
4. ssh to the plug at 192.168.2.20 with username and password 'ubnt':
```
ssh -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 ubnt@192.168.2.20
```
5. Test to determine whether the outlet is switched on:
```
cat /proc/power/relay1
(returns 1 if on, 0 if off)
```
6. If not, turn on the relay:
```
echo 1 > /proc/power/relay1
```
7. You're ready to run the monitor script in this repo:
```
./mpower.sh
(enter password when prompted. the default is just 'ubnt', same as the username)
```

The script will record the current time, active power, current, voltage, and power factor (in that order) every second. The most interesting values are probably the active power and current. A few notes:
 * The voltage reported by the device is the mains voltage.
 * Active power = voltage * current * power factor.
 * If you associated the device with your wireless network, specify its new hostname/IP as an argument to the script.
